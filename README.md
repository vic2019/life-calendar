# Life Calendar

Life Calendar is a light-hearted app for your amusement and philosophical self-reflection.

It calculates and displays a table of tiles, with each tile representing two weeks of your life. You can record your past or future life stages by highlighting the tiles, and add notes to the selected period of time. Log in first to save your edits.

The motivation behind a life calendar is discussed more in depth in Tim Urban's [article](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html).

This project is built with React/Create React App and deployed on AWS.
